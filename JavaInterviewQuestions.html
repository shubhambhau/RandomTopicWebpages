    <h2>What is Custom Exception in java
        <li>
            <ol>
                A custom exception is a user defined class that extends Exception or Runtime Exception to represent
                application specific error conditions.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                It helps make error handling more meaningful and readable by giving descriptive names to exceptions.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                We create it by defining a class and throwing it where that specific error scenario occurs.
            </ol>
        </li>
