    <h2>What is Custom Exception in java</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>
            A custom exception is a user defined class that extends Exception or Runtime Exception to represent
            application specific error conditions.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            It helps make error handling more meaningful and readable by giving descriptive names to exceptions.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            We create it by defining a class and throwing it where that specific error scenario occurs.
        </ol>

    <h2>What is the difference between the Compile time exception and Runtime Exception</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>A Compile time exception also known as a checked exception, is checked by the compiler and must be either handled with try-catch or declared with throws.</ol>
        <ol>These are often explicitly thrown by the programmer, such as IOException or SQLException.</ol>
        <ol>A Runtime Exception, also known as an unchecked exception, does not need to be handled or declared, for example ArithmeticException or NullPointerException./ol>
        <ol></ol>
    </li>
