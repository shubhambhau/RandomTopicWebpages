    <h2>What is Custom Exception in java</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>
            A custom exception is a user defined class that extends Exception or Runtime Exception to represent
            application specific error conditions.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            It helps make error handling more meaningful and readable by giving descriptive names to exceptions.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            We create it by defining a class and throwing it where that specific error scenario occurs.
        </ol>
    </li>
    <h2>What is the difference between the Compile time exception and Runtime Exception</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>A Compile time exception also known as a checked exception, is checked by the compiler and must be either handled with try-catch or declared with throws.</ol>
        <ol>These are often explicitly thrown by the programmer, such as IOException or SQLException.</ol>
        <ol>A Runtime Exception, also known as an unchecked exception, does not need to be handled or declared, for example ArithmeticException or NullPointerException./ol>
        <ol></ol>
    </li>
    <h2>What is the difference between Map interface and List interface</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>The List interface stores elements in an ordered sequence, allows duplicates, and is index-based, with implemntations like ArrayList and LinkedList.</ol>
        <ol>The Mpa interface stores key-value pairs, does not allow duplicate keys, and provide fast lookups by key, wih implementations like HashMap and TreeMap.</ol>
        <ol>In short, List is for collections of elements, while Map is for mapping between keys and values.</ol>
    </li>
    <h2>What is the difference between ArrayList and HashSet</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>ArrayList stores elements in an ordered sequence, allows duplicates, and is index-based, so you can access elements by position.</ol>
        <ol>HashSet stores unique elements only, does not maintain insertion order, and is based on hashing for faster lookups.</ol>
        <ol>Use ArrayList when order and duplicates matter, and HashSet when uniqueness and fast search are priorities.</ol>
    </li>
    <h2>What is the difference between Map interface and List interface</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>The List interface stores elements in an ordered sequence allows duplicates, and is index based with implementations like ArrayList and LinkedList</ol>
        <ol>The Map interface stores key value pair does not allow duplicate keys and provide fast lookups by key with implementation like HashMap and TreeMap</ol>
        <ol>In short, List is for collection of elements while Map is for mapping between keys and values.</ol>
    </li>
    <h2>what is the difference between the == and equals</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>== checks the memory address or the reference</ol>
        <ol>equals checks the content in the String</ol>
        <ol>But, if talking about equals method of the Object class there is also been address is checked.</ol>
    </li>
